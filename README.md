# Compound-V
### This is a FORK, that implements a new UI! This does **NOT** change any of the core functionality!
### Furthermore, the UI is not fully complete! If anyone wants to help fix this mess, please PR!
See a screenshot of the UI [here](https://prnt.sc/Vej3_wHfuxGv)

#### This repo uses [xx4-bfv-aimassist](https://github.com/exex4/xx4-bfv-aimassist) as its core!
- - - -
#### It contains the following adjustments:  
 - ##### Auto-Shoot option
 - ##### Auto-Scope option
 - ##### Dodge-Mode: While aiming somebody with the aimbot you continuously crouch and uncrouch. It makes you way harder to get shot.
 - ##### Hunt-Mode: Allows you to only aimbot one person. Distance limit will be set to None and you don't have to press the Trigger-Button. You will also see the distance to your current hunt. 
 - ##### Focus-Mode: Won't switch target even if the target is behind an obstacle. Good against peak snipers
 - ##### Anti-Bulletdrop: Measures the distance to the current target and offsets the pitch rotation by a well fitting factor
 - ##### More keycodes (Mouse Extra Keys)
 - ##### Faster more snappy aiming 
 - ##### Batch included for easy usage
